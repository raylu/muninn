The Sisters of Muninn

--

I woke up in a strange bed in a strange room.
To my left, a woman was dipping a towel in a bowl of water.
She wore a familiar-looking garb that I couldn't place right that second - my mind was still a little muddled.
She noticed that I was awake and stopped what she was doing.

"Hi", she said while offering me a smile.
Not the kind of smile that comes to you when you're happy, but the kind that you offer when you should.
I tried to sit up and speak at the same time, but my throat was dry and my body's aches and pains made themselves known.
She came over, uncapped a bottle of water on the table next to me, and help me sit up.

Drinking had never been such a chore, nor so painful.
I took a few sips and tried to thank her, which hurt.
It took a few tries, but I eventually croaked out a "thanks".
She offered me that same smile.

I was confused - how did I get here?

"How did I get here?"

"We found your pod after it crashed a few miles from here.
You were in pretty bad shape, but we were prepared for that, luckily."
She continued explaining but the sounds stopped holding meaning for me.

Ah, yes, I remembered: that's the garb of a sister of Muninn.
I was probably safe here.
With that thought, I drifted back off to sleep.
I had the impression that she gave me a strange look when she noticed I was passing out again.

--

The second time I awoke, I was less surprised at the bed and room I woke up in, but still surprised.
I couldn't sense anyone else in the room with me, but it was night and the room was very dark.
I tried to sit up and surprised myself with how easily I was able to do it.
I guess I'd gotten a lot better - or I just really needed to pee.

There was a faint light coming from the desk where the bottle of water was.
I pushed it and the button turned on the lamp.
I immediately regretted this decision and closed my eyes as my pupils tried to compensate.

A few seconds later I was out of bed.
I took a few more seconds to steady myself, then put on the slippers that had been put next to my bed.
I moved to the door, which opened with no resistance.
I walked out into the hallway.

To my left was mostly darkness.
To my right was light and sound from around a corner - the sound of dishes being washed.

My first instinct was to stay silent and hide, but after a moment of reflection that made no sense.
If I was being held captive here or these people meant me harm and they weren't actually the Sisters of Muninn, I'd know it already.
They'd saved me at their own expense and risk.
I walked to the right and turned the corner.

The woman who I saw the first time was indeed washing dishes.
I could smell food and it quickly reminded me of how hungry I was.

"Should you be moving around already?" she asked me.

"Need to pee," I answered.

"Oh."
She smiled a different smile this time.
"Straight down that hallway, on your left."
She pointed back the way I came.

I turned around and left.

When I left the toiletroom, I was feeling much better and much hungrier.
In the direction of the kitchen, the sound of running water had been replaced by humming.
I followed the humming into the light of the kitchen.
There was a tall table in the kitchen which I walked up to and leaned on - standing was a bit of a chore.
She was drying the dishes now.

"Um...", I started.
I wasn't sure what the proper social protocol was here.
What's the correct way to ask for food if you're a starving freeloader who nearly died and was saved by the altruism of
an organization you had previously never dealt with and you had barely exchanged 3 sentences with the person you were asking?
I didn't even know her name, nor she mine.

As I debated the options, a door opened and another sister walked in carrying dangerously many plates and a bowl held between her forearms.

"Oh, it's awake," the newcomer said.

"It?", I asked, rather taken aback.
Ungendered pronouns were generally reserved for situations you couldn't identify the gender and for slaves.
Alternatively, it was a playful insult, but we didn't know each other that well - or at all.

The second woman delivered an impish grin.

The first woman saved me.
"Yes, /he/ is, Elle. And probably hungry too."

The second one had set down the bowl she was carrying and was about to set down the rest of the food.
"Can he eat in here?"

I answered, "Um, I'd prefer to sit. If that's okay."

She frowned an overly-expressive, exaggerated frown and lifted the plates back up, leaving the bowl where it was.

"Follow me", she said, and made for the door she came through.
I tried to open the door for her, but she made it there first and opened it with her foot.
I followed her through.
The first woman finished drying the last plate, took a clean fork, picked up the bowl that had been left behind, and followed also.

The dining room had two long, wooden tables.
Instead of individual chairs, there were benches.
Most of the remaining plates were empty so the leftovers must have been gathered onto what Elle was carrying.

She set them down at the nearest end of the table and the bowl joined the plates shortly afterward.
The first woman set down the fork in front of me. "Thanks", I said, and dug in.

They sat and watched me eat the way you'd watch a stray, starving puppy eat: with that particular kind of amused expression.
I binged.
"This is the best food ever created", I said.
Still with a fawning grin, Elle spoke. "Hunger is the best sauce in the world."

"So said a man back when everyone lived on one world", the first woman replied.
"I'm Anne, by the way."
Finally, I could stop thinking of her as the first woman.

I took a moment to finish chewing and said "Hi Anne, Elle.
I never got a chance to say this, but thanks for saving my life."

"No problem! All in a day's work", Elle replied.
Her grin changed from watching-a-puppy back to the imp.
After a moment, Anne asked, "So tell us about yourself".

"I'm..."
I paused to think about what to say.
I had the attention of both the women.
Perhaps I should tell them my name?
No, that wouldn't do.
Expectations were high in this dining room.
"...very thirsty", I finished.

Both of them moved to stand at the same time, but Elle was closer to the kitchen door so Anne sat back down.
Elle giggled and left to get water.
Anne gave me a strange look.

--

Elle returned with 3 cups of what probably wasn't water, carrying them precariously with her small hands.
She set all three down, then she and Anne both took a cup.
I took the third and stared at it.
It was greenish-yellow and warm, like tea, but with bubbles inside.
Some of them floated to the top, even though the glass was still.

They had both started sipping the drink and I hadn't touched mine.
"You probably don't have the poisoned one", Elle said.
That grin again.

I gave it a cautious sip.
It was much sweeter than tea, but quite good.
I proceeded to empty most of the glass.

"So it was good, then?" asked Anne, as if I were a scared kid trying something new for the first time.

"This is the best drink ever created" was my reply.
That earned me a chuckle and another giggle.
I sat back a little and relaxed from injesting everything in front of me for the moment.
"So, where am I?"

Anne waved a finger at me and maintained her matronly demeanor.
"You have to answer one of our questions if you want an answer to yours.
Fair's fair."

"Okay", I said.

Elle: "What's your name?"
Me: "John. Where am I?"
Anne: "Trinity"
Me: "Trinity? I've never heard of that system."
Anne: "No, Trinity is the name of this planet."

That didn't really help place me anywhere.
Planets are officially named after their solar system and a number based on distance from the sun.
Sol 3, for example.
Some planets had nicknames, such as Earth.

"What's the real name for this planet?" I asked.
Anne shook her finger at me again.

"No, it's our turn", she said.
I took another bite of something.

Elle: "Where did you come from?"
Me: "I was born in Anoikis.
     The last place I know for sure where I was was New Kor-Azor.
     What's the real name for this planet?"
Anne: "Trinity! But technically, it's Fensi 3."

Fensi.
That wasn't too far from Amdonen.
Not that I'd get there any time soon with my pod destroyed.

Anne: "Do you know how you crashed?"
Me: "Not entirely clear. I was getting ready to go to Amdonen.
     The jump gate in KA mis-fired and I ended up... somewhere.
     Near Fensi 3, I guess."
Elle: "A gate misfired and you ended up in the gravitational pull of Trinity, not in a rock or just in the middle of nowhere?
       Do you know how unlikely that is?"

My turn to delivery a teeth-baring smile.
"My question. And the most important one yet:
What am I drinking?"

Anne answered, "Hot pop".

"Hot... pop", I said, slowly, with rising inflection.
I wasn't sure if that counted as a question.

Elle answered anyway, "It's hot and it pops. See the bubbles?"
Without pause, she plunged forward.
"There's no way you got lucky enough to end up inside Trinity's gravitational pull by accident.
There are 7 planets, 1 sun, 2 jump gates, and a billion cubic kilometers of nothingness in Fensi.
There's a billion more in between systems.
Your pod has no warp drive and certainly no jump drive, so if you hadn't been pulled in by Trinity, you would have been stranded.
Pods are basically impossible to scan down,
so even if people knew you were somewhere in Fensi it'd be a long time before someone found you."

This was pretty basic knowledge that she was sharing with me.
As someone flying around in a pod, I obviously knew all this.
Though the bit about scanning down pods wasn't quite right.
Scanning tech had come a long way in the last decade.
The newest deep space probes could get a lock on a pod in minutes.

Fensi was far from empire-controlled space, though.
The claws of the empire and the fruits of technology would be slow in getting here.
I got the impression from Elle's enthusiastic explanation the she wanted to go to space but lacked the means to.
That didn't bode well for me if I wanted a quick exit off this planet.

Me: "That was really a question..."
Elle: "Do you realize how astronomically lucky you are?"
Me: "An empire-controlled jump gate fires countless times taking pods and ships from KA to Amdonen and I end up nearly dead in Fensi.
     I don't feel terribly lucky.
     More importantly, what's in this hot pop?"
Anne: "You're going to be answering questions until next year if you want an answer to that one."

Smirks on both of their faces.
This was something they were proud of, something they probably invented.

"Fine", I said.
"Do I get another question then?"

"Yep", replied Elle.
"What happened after the jump, after you landed in Fensi?"

Apparently, that counted as my question.
I sighed an unnecessary, dramatic sigh.
"I was pretty disoriented. My pod was still moving forward from the jump.
It started spinning, slowly at first, speeing up until it got out of control. I panicked and eventually blacked out."
I paused a bit to see if I had any memories before waking up to a beautiful woman by my bedside,
not quite in her prime but not quite ready to settle down and grow old.

My thoughts got a little distracted, so I finished off my hot pop and used a backup question.
"Why is it called Trinity?"

Anne answered, "Because it sounds better than Fensi 3."

"And we're the 3rd rock from the sun", Elle added unnecessarily.

I forked something and prepared to eat it while waiting for their next question.
Eventually, I realized I was rather full but it had taken a while for my body to catch up with my binge eating.
"It's your turn to ask a question."

"I know", Anne said, then paused, letting a thoughtful expression take over her face.
"Do you have any more questions for us?"

Perhaps I should ask for a way off this planet?
But that would seem ungrateful after they had saved my life, nursed me back to health,
and just got done feeding me and introducing me to the wonders of hot pop.
So instead I asked, "how come we're speaking English?"

Anne gave me a very strange look.
